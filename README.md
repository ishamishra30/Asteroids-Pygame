# Asteroids-Pygame
This game includes:
1. Loading images and displaying them on the screen
2. Handling user input in order to control the game
3. Moving objects according to the game logic
4. Detecting collisions between objects
5. Displaying text on the screen
6. Playing sounds

The project will be broken into ten steps:
1. Setting up Pygame for a Python project
2. Handing input in the game
3. Loading images and showing them on the screen
4. Creating game objects with an image, a position, and some logic
5. Moving the spaceship
6. Moving the asteroids and detecting collisions with the spaceship
7. Shooting bullets and destroying asteroids
8. Splitting asteroids into smaller ones
9. Playing sounds
10. Handling the end of the game

Benefits after you code for game:
1. learn computational thinking
2. learn to use logic and problem solving
3. learn to anticipate and avoid problems 
4. learn structural thinking 
5. learn algorithmic thinking
